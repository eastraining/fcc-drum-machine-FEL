# Drum Machine
A drum machine project for FreeCodeCamp. View it here: http://eastraining.github.io/fcc-drum-machine-FEL.

## Sources
All sound clips are taken from the [Cymatics Cobra Hip Hop Sample pack](https://cymatics.fm/products/cobra-hip-hop-sample-pack).

## Architecture
Used create-react-app as a base, with class-based React structure. Global event listeners have been added to each key to allow keyboard activation.

## Further improvements
To introduce caching for the audio files so they play instantly (there's currently a delay with playing the music loops).
